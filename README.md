# Optimizing-Booking-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning-British-Airways-

🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Data Science Project on British Airways! 🚀

I’ve recently completed a Machine Learning project to predict Booking Completion for British Airways using two powerful models: Decision Tree and Random Forest. Here’s a quick rundown of the process:

🔍 Data Exploration:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling both numerical and categorical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
🔧 Model Development:

Built a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier to predict booking completion based on various features.
Applied Standard Scaling to normalize numerical features and Ordinal Encoding for categorical features.
Compared the performance of both models to select the best one for prediction accuracy.
🎯 Performance Evaluation:

Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy metrics and fine-tuned them for optimal results.
The Random Forest model, with its ensemble approach, significantly boosted the prediction accuracy.
🌳 Feature Importance:

Analyzed and visualized the most important features that influence booking completion, providing insights into how the models make predictions.
📊 Tools Used:

Python (with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and model development
